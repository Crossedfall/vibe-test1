# Snake Game Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a simple snake game using Pygame.

## File Structure
- `snake_game.py`: The main game file containing all the game logic.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize Pygame and Setup Display**
   - Import Pygame and initialize it.
   - Set up the game window with appropriate dimensions.
   - Configure display settings such as title and background color.

2. **Implement Game Loop**
   - Create a main game loop that continues until the game is over.
   - Handle events such as key presses for snake movement.

3. **Implement Snake Movement**
   - Create a snake object with initial position and direction.
   - Update snake position based on user input and game state.

4. **Collision Detection**
   - Check for collisions with the game boundaries.
   - Check for collisions with the snake's own body.

5. **Scoring System**
   - Initialize a score variable.
   - Increment score when the snake eats food.

6. **Game Over Logic**
   - End the game when a collision is detected.
   - Display final score.

## Code Structure
The code will be organized into logical sections:
1. Imports and initialization
2. Game class or main game functions
3. Game loop
4. Event handling
5. Game logic (movement, collision, scoring)

## Next Steps
1. Create `snake_game.py` in the "snake-game" directory.
2. Implement the game logic as outlined above.

## Example Code Structure
```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Game variables
screen_width = 800
screen_height = 600
snake_pos = [100, 50]
snake_body = [[100, 50], [90, 50], [80, 50]]

# Game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Event handling
        pass
    
    # Game logic
    # Update snake position
    # Check collisions
    # Update score
    
    # Display update
    pygame.display.update()
```

This plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing the snake game using Pygame.
